# CSCI-1082-Final-Project-LunarLander
Final Project for CSCI-1082

We will be building a version of the 1979 arcade gane Lunar Lander.
This game will contain a rocket with thrusters to modulate your speed as you land, a fuel meter, potential obstacles to dodge while attempting to land, the landing space will change each time you start a new game.
